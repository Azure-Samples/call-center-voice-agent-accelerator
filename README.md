Welcome to the *Call Center Real-time Voice Agent* solution accelerator. It's a lightweight template to create speech-to-speech voice agents that deliver personalized self-service experiences and natural-sounding voices, seamlessly integrated with telephony systems. This solution accelerator uses  **Azure Voice Live API** and **Azure Communication Services** — Start locally, deploy later to Azure Web App. No PSTN number needed.

The Azure voice live API is a solution enabling low-latency, high-quality speech to speech interactions for voice agents. The API is designed for developers seeking scalable and efficient voice-driven experiences as it eliminates the need to manually orchestrate multiple components. By integrating speech recognition, generative AI, and text to speech functionalities into a single, unified interface, it provides an end-to-end solution for creating seamless experiences. Learn more about [Azure Voice Live API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live).

The Azure Communication Services Calls Automation APIs provide telephony integration and real-time event triggers to perform actions based on custom business logic specific to their domain. Within the call automation APIs developers can use simple AI powered APIs, which can be used to play personalized greeting messages, recognize conversational voice inputs to gather information on contextual questions to drive a more self-service model with customers, use sentiment analysis to improve customer service overall. Learn more about [Azure Communication Services (Call Automation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/call-automation/call-automation).

## Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features. Learn more from [Security for Azure AI Voice Live API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/speech-service/voice-live/data-privacy-security).

### Security Considerations

ACS currently does not support Managed Identity. The ACS connection string is stored securely in Key Vault and injected into the container app via its secret URL.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Deploy in your local environment</b></summary>

 ### Local environment

If you're not using one of the above options for opening the project, then you'll need to:

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * `bash`
    * [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)

2. Download the project code:

    ```shell
    azd init -t Azure-Samples/call-center-voice-agent-accelerator/
    ```
    **Note:** the above command should be run in a new folder of your choosing. You do not need to run `git clone` to download the project source code. `azd init` handles this for you.

3. Open the project folder in your terminal or editor.
4. Continue with the [deploying steps](#deploying).

</details>
 
### Deploying

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces) or in [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers) or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure following the following steps. 

To change the `azd` parameters from the default values, follow the steps [here](./docs/customizing_azd_parameters.md). 

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```
    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "flask-app"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location (like "eastus"). Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code. If you get an error with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for some of the resources.

3. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI, and you should see the API output! 🎉

4. When you've made any changes to the app code, you can just run:

    ```shell
    azd deploy
    ```

>[!NOTE]
>AZD will also setup the local Python environment for you, using `venv` and installing the required packages.


>[!NOTE]
>- Region: swedencentral is strongly recommended due to AI Foundry availability.
>- Post-Deployment: You can also setup ACS Event Grid subscription and PSTN to use the ACS client.



## Testing the Agent

After deployment, you can verify that your Voice Agent is running correctly using either the Web Client (for quick testing) or the ACS Phone Client (for simulating a real-world call center scenario).

🌐 Web Client (Test Mode)

Use this browser-based client to confirm your Container App is up and responding.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the **Resource Group** created by your deployment.
2. Find and open the **Container App** resource.
3. On the **Overview** page, copy the **Application URL**.
4. Open the URL in your browser — a demo webpage should load.
5. Click **Start Talking to Agent** to begin a voice session using your browser’s microphone and speaker.
6. Click **Stop Conversation** to end the session.

> ⚠️ This web client is intended for testing purposes only. Use the ACS client below for production-like call flow testing.



📞 ACS Client (Call Center Scenario)

This simulates a real inbound phone call to your voice agent using **Azure Communication Services (ACS)**.


#### 1. Set Up Incoming Call Webhook

1. In the same resource group, find and open the **Communication Services** resource.
2. In the left-hand menu, click **Events**.
3. Click **+ Event Subscription** and fill in the following:

   - **Event Type**: `IncomingCall`
   - **Endpoint Type**: `Web Hook`
   - **Endpoint Address**:
     ```
     https://<your-container-app-url>/acs/incomingcall
     ```
     Replace `<your-container-app-url>` with the Application URL from your Container App.

📸 Refer to the screenshot below for guidance:

![Event Subscription screenshot](./docs/images/acs_eventsubscription_v0.0.1.png)


#### 2. Get a Phone Number

If you haven't already, obtain a phone number for your ACS resource:

👉 [How to get a phone number (Microsoft Docs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp-new)


#### 3. Call the Agent

Once your event subscription is configured and the phone number is active:

- Dial the ACS number.
- Your call will connect to the real-time voice agent powered by Azure Voice Live.


#### Local execution

Once the environment has been deployed with `azd up` you can also run the application locally.

Please follow the instructions in [the instructions in `service`](./service/README.md)

Please refer to [Transparency Note](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/speech-service/voice-live/transparency-note) for responsible AI transparency details of the voice live api.

### Resource Clean-up

When you no longer need the resources created in this article, run the following command to power down the app:

```bash
azd down
```

If you want to redeploy to a different region, delete the `.azure` directory before running `azd up` again. In a more advanced scenario, you could selectively edit files within the `.azure` directory to change the region.
